/**
 * Node-runnable entry point for the fill act:
 *
 *   pnpm orders:fill
 *
 * WIRING ONLY — it binds the real filesystem, the real data dir, the real genesis + log
 * and a real readline prompt to `recordFill`, which holds the flow, every refusal, the
 * write ordering and the rollback. Keeping the wiring in its own module is what lets the
 * test import the flow with no side effects: importing this file runs the act.
