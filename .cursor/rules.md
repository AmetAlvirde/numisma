## Monorepo overview

The project is built as a monorepo using Turborepo, allowing for modular
development while maintaining a consistent codebase across multiple
applications and packages.

This monorepo currently contains the foundational packages with plans to expand
into a complete ecosystem of applications:

- Foundation: Core types and database layers are implemented
- In Development: UI component library and applications

### Packages Overview

#### @numisma/types

Core domain types that define the data model for the entire application. This
package contains TypeScript interfaces and type definitions for all domain
entities such as Portfolio, Position, and Asset.

#### @numisma/db

Database layer that provides repository implementations and database access
utilities. This package uses Prisma ORM to interact with the PostgreSQL
database and implements the repository pattern for clean data access.

#### @numisma/ui

UI component library ("Component Forest") that will provide reusable React
components for building consistent user interfaces. This package builds on
shadcn UI components and Tailwind CSS for styling.

### Applications

#### Web Application (apps/web)

The main application that will deliver portfolio management, position
tracking, and performance analytics for traders and investors.

#### Admin Application (apps/admin)

Back office application for data management and administrative tasks. This
application will provide CRUD operations for all entities and content
management.

#### Documentation (apps/docs)

Knowledge base and documentation site. This site will serve as a central hub or
developer resources, user guides, and API references.

## Architecture Guidelines

### Package Organization

**Pattern**: `**/*`
**Advice**: Follow the monorepo structure with clear package boundaries:

- `@numisma/types`: Domain types and interfaces only
- `@numisma/db`: Database access layer
- `@numisma/ui`: UI component library
- `apps/*`: Application implementations

### Dependency Direction

**Pattern**: `**/*`
**Advice**: Maintain the correct dependency direction: apps → @numisma/ui →
@numisma/db → @numisma/types. Never allow circular dependencies between
packages.

### API Design

**Pattern**: `apps/*/pages/api/**/*.ts`
**Advice**: Use RESTful principles with resource-based URLs. Structure endpoints
as /api/[resource]/[action]. Return consistent response objects with { success,
data, error, metadata } pattern.

## TypeScript Guidelines

### Type Definitions

**Pattern**: `**/*.ts`
**Advice**: Always define proper types for variables, parameters, and return
values. Avoid using 'any' type. For financial calculations, consider using a
decimal library instead of native JavaScript Number.

### Domain Types

**Pattern**: `**/*.ts`
**Advice**: Always import and use types from @numisma/types for domain entities
like Portfolio, Position, Asset, etc. Don't redefine these types locally.

### Type Guards

**Pattern**: `**/*.ts`
**Advice**: Implement type guards for complex domain objects to ensure type
safety at runtime, especially for data coming from external sources or
API calls.

### Strict Mode

**Pattern**: `**/tsconfig.json`
**Advice**: Always maintain strict: true, noImplicitAny: true, strictNullChecks:
true in all tsconfig.json files.

## React & Next.js Guidelines

### React Components

**Pattern**: `**/*.tsx`
**Advice**: Use functional components with hooks. Extract complex logic into
custom hooks. Keep components focused on a single responsibility. Always
create framework agnostic components, so they could be seamlessly used by
apps written in other frameworks than Next.js. Use React.memo() for
performance optimization when appropriate.

### Props Typing

**Pattern**: `**/*.tsx`
**Advice**: Always define an interface or type for component props. Use
Partial<Props> when making some props optional. Consider using
React.ComponentProps<> for extending HTML element props.

### Next.js Pages

**Pattern**: `apps/*/pages/**/*.tsx`
**Advice**: Keep page components lightweight. Move business logic to hooks or
services. Use getServerSideProps or getStaticProps for data fetching when
appropriate. Use appropriate caching strategies based on data freshness
requirements.

### API Routes

**Pattern**: `apps/*/pages/api/**/*.ts`
**Advice**: Keep API routes focused on request handling. Move business logic to
service layers. Implement proper error handling and validation. Use appropriate
HTTP status codes.

## UI Component Guidelines

### Component Forest

**Pattern**: `packages/ui/**/*.tsx`
**Advice**: Maintain a consistent component API. Use composition over
inheritance. Implement proper accessibility attributes. Provide good default
props. Document component usage with JSDoc. Always create framework agnostic
components, so they could be seamlessly used by apps written in other
frameworks than Next.js

### Tailwind Usage

**Pattern**: `**/*.tsx`
**Advice**: Use Tailwind's utility classes consistently. For complex
components, consider extracting common patterns to component variants.
Avoid mixing Tailwind with other styling approaches in the same component.

### Responsive Design

**Pattern**: `**/*.tsx`
**Advice**: Use Tailwind's responsive prefixes consistently (sm:, md:, lg:,
xl:). Design for mobile-first. Test across different viewport sizes. Use
flexible layouts rather than fixed sizes where possible.

### Charts and Visualizations

**Pattern**: `**/*.tsx`
**Advice**: Use Recharts for data visualization. Implement responsive charts.
Ensure charts are accessible. Provide sensible defaults for colors, margins,
and axis formatting. Implement proper loading and error states.

## Database Access Guidelines

### Prisma Usage

**Pattern**: `packages/db/**/*.ts`
**Advice**: Follow the repository pattern to abstract database access.
Implement proper transaction handling. Use Prisma's relation queries efficiently
to avoid N+1 problems. Apply proper database indexing for query optimization.

### Data Validation

**Pattern**: `packages/db/**/*.ts`
**Advice**: Implement validation for all database inputs. Use Zod or similar
for schema validation. Validate data before it reaches the database layer.
Handle validation errors gracefully.

### Query Optimization

**Pattern**: `packages/db/**/*.ts`
**Advice**: Select only needed fields. Use proper pagination for large
datasets. Implement query caching for frequent reads. Monitor query performance
in development. Consider database denormalization for complex reporting queries.

## Financial Calculation Guidelines

### Precision Handling

**Pattern**: `**/*.ts`
**Advice**: Use a decimal library like decimal.js for financial calculations to
avoid floating-point errors. Never use JavaScript's native Number type for
money calculations. Store amounts in the smallest currency unit (e.g., cents).

### Portfolio Calculations

**Pattern**: `**/*.ts`
**Advice**: Implement time-weighted return (TWR) for portfolio performance.
Calculate metrics like ROI, Sharpe ratio, and max drawdown correctly.
Document calculation methodologies to ensure transparency.

### Date Handling

**Pattern**: `**/*.ts`
**Advice**: Use date-fns or similar for date manipulations. Pay special
attention to timezone handling. Implement proper handling for the 'genesis'
date concept for pre-tracked positions.

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

**Pattern**: `**/*.test.ts`
**Advice**: Test business logic thoroughly. Aim for high test coverage of core
financial calculations. Mock external dependencies. Test edge cases and error
scenarios.

### Integration Tests

**Pattern**: `**/*.spec.ts`
**Advice**: Test API endpoints and database interactions. Use appropriate test
doubles. Set up isolated test environments. Clean up test data after tests.

### UI Component Tests

**Pattern**: `**/*.test.tsx`
**Advice**: Use React Testing Library for component testing. Test user
interactions. Verify accessibility. Test responsive behavior. Test component
prop variations.

## Performance Guidelines

### React Performance

**Pattern**: `**/*.tsx`
**Advice**: Use React.memo() for expensive components. Implement useMemo and
useCallback for expensive calculations and event handlers. Avoid unnecessary
re-renders. Use virtualization for long lists.

### Data Fetching

**Pattern**: `**/*.ts`
**Advice**: Implement proper data caching with React Query. Use pagination for
large datasets. Implement optimistic UI updates.

### Bundle Size

**Advice**: Use dynamic imports for code splitting. Optimize third-party
dependencies. Monitor bundle size with tools like Next.js bundle analyzer.
Lazy load non-critical components.

## Security Guidelines

### Authentication

**Pattern**: `**/*.ts`
**Advice**: Use JWT or Auth.js for authentication. Implement proper token
expiration and refresh. Store sensitive information securely. Implement CSRF
protection. Use HTTPS for all communications.

### Authorization

**Pattern**: `**/*.ts`
**Advice**: Implement role-based access control. Check authorization on both
client and server. Validate user permissions for all sensitive operations. Log
security events for audit purposes.

### Input Validation

**Pattern**: `**/*.ts`
**Advice**: Validate all user inputs on the server side. Sanitize outputs to
prevent XSS. Use prepared statements for database queries. Implement rate
limiting for public endpoints.

## Error Handling Guidelines

### API Error Handling

**Pattern**: `apps/*/pages/api/**/*.ts`
**Advice**: Return consistent error responses. Use appropriate HTTP status
codes. Include error codes and messages. Avoid exposing internal error details
to clients. Log errors for debugging.

### Client Error Handling

**Pattern**: `**/*.tsx`
**Advice**: Implement error boundaries. Show user-friendly error messages.
Provide recovery options when possible. Log client-side errors to the server
for monitoring.

### Financial Calculation Errors

**Pattern**: `**/*.ts`
**Advice**: Implement defensive programming for financial calculations.
Handle edge cases like division by zero. Validate inputs before calculations.
Document error handling approach for financial operations.

## Documentation Guidelines

### Code Documentation

**Pattern**: `**/*.ts`
**Advice**: Use JSDoc for function and class documentation. Document complex
algorithms. Add comments for non-obvious code. Keep documentation
up-to-date with code changes. Always include a comment at the beggining of
each file with its relative path and its purpose. Create comments with the
@ai-guidance directive for relevant information for AI models to work with
the code you write.

### API Documentation

**Pattern**: `apps/*/pages/api/**/*.ts`
**Advice**: Document all API endpoints with input/output schemas. Document
authentication requirements. Provide examples of request/response pairs.
Document error codes and their meanings.

### Component Documentation

**Advice**: Implement proper state transitions for position lifecycle
(PLANNED, ACTIVE, CLOSED, CANCELLED). Validate transitions to ensure business
rules. Maintain audit trail of lifecycle changes.

### Portfolio Valuation

**Pattern**: `**/*.ts`
**Advice**: Calculate portfolio valuations at different time periods. Implement
proper handling of 'genesis' positions. Store historical valuations for
performance tracking. Calculate relevant financial metrics.
