# Plan: Light/Dark Theme Implementation

## Phase 1: Basic Theme Switching UI & Logic

- [x] Define theme variables/styles for light and dark modes (e.g., colors, fonts). Consider using CSS variables or theme objects depending on the framework.
- [x] Implement a UI element (e.g., button, toggle, dropdown) to allow users to manually select "Light", "Dark", or "System".
- [x] Implement the core logic to apply the selected theme (light or dark) globally to the application's UI.
- [x] **Verification:**
  - [x] Manually select "Light" theme via the UI element. Visually confirm all relevant UI components render in light mode.
  - [x] Manually select "Dark" theme via the UI element. Visually confirm all relevant UI components render in dark mode. Test across multiple screens/components.

## Phase 2: System Theme Preference Detection

- [x] Implement platform-specific logic to detect the user's preferred system theme (e.g., using `prefers-color-scheme` media query in web).
- [x] Expose the detected system theme ("light" or "dark") to the application's theme logic.
- [x] **Verification:**
  - [x] Add logging or a debug indicator to show the currently detected system theme.

## Phase 3: Integration and Default Behavior

- [x] Modify the theme logic:
  - If the user selected "Light" or "Dark" manually, use that theme.
  - If the user selected "System", apply the theme detected in Phase 2.
- [x] Set the default theme selection to "System" on initial app load.
- [x] Ensure the theme updates dynamically if the system theme changes _while the app is running_ (if feasible and desired).
- [x] **Verification:**
  - [x] Set system theme to Light. Launch the app. Verify it defaults to light theme (assuming default selection is "System").
  - [x] Set system theme to Dark. Launch the app. Verify it defaults to dark theme.
  - [x] While the app is running (and set to "System"), change the OS theme. Verify the app's theme updates accordingly (if dynamic updates were implemented).
  - [x] Manually select "Light". Verify the app switches to light mode, overriding the system setting.
  - [x] Manually select "Dark". Verify the app switches to dark mode, overriding the system setting.

## Phase 4: Persistence (Recommended)

- [x] Choose a storage mechanism (e.g., `localStorage`, settings file).
- [x] Save the user's explicit theme selection ("Light", "Dark", or "System") to storage whenever they change it using the UI element.
- [x] On app startup, load the saved preference. If no preference is saved, default to "System".
- [x] **Verification:**
  - [x] Select "Light" theme manually. Close and reopen the app. Verify "Light" theme is active and the UI element shows "Light" selected.
  - [x] Select "Dark" theme manually. Close and reopen the app. Verify "Dark" theme is active and the UI element shows "Dark" selected.
  - [x] Select "System" theme manually. Close and reopen the app. Verify the theme matches the current system theme and the UI element shows "System" selected.
  - [x] Clear the saved preference from storage. Relaunch the app. Verify it defaults to the "System" setting and applies the correct theme based on the OS preference.
