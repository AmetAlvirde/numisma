# Numisma Database Layer

This package provides repository implementations and database access utilities for the Numisma application.

## Type Mapper Refactoring Status

We've completed the refactoring of repositories to use type-safe mappers, providing better type safety when converting between Prisma models and domain models.

### Current Progress

- ✅ Created initial type mappers for basic enum conversions
- ✅ Created entity mappers for complex entity conversions
- ✅ Updated simpler repositories (Asset, Market) to use the type mappers
- ✅ Converted repositories to use OperationResult pattern for consistent error handling
- ✅ Implemented Portfolio repository with type mappers
- ✅ Completed Position repository refactoring with type-safe mappers
- ✅ Implemented proper handling of DateOrGenesis for date fields
- ✅ Fixed type inconsistencies between Prisma schema and domain models

### Implementation Status

1. **Type Mappers**

   - ✅ Basic enum conversions in type-mappers.ts
   - ✅ Date/Genesis handling utilities
   - ✅ Completed mapPositionToPrisma implementation with proper type-safety

2. **Entity Mappers**

   - ✅ Implemented ToPrisma mappers for Asset and Market entities
   - ✅ Implemented ToPrisma mapper for Portfolio entity
   - ✅ Implemented Position entity mapper with full support for nested entities

3. **Repository Implementations**

   - ✅ Asset Repository (completed)
   - ✅ Market Repository (completed)
   - ✅ Portfolio Repository (completed)
   - ✅ Position Repository (completed)
   - ⚠️ Additional repositories may still need updating

4. **Type Safety Improvements**
   - ✅ Implemented OperationResult pattern for consistent error handling
   - ✅ Improved handling of null/undefined values with conditional property assignments
   - ✅ Fixed type inconsistencies between Prisma and domain models
   - ✅ Added proper type handling for DateOrGenesis conversions

### Challenges Addressed

- **Complex Entity Relationships**: The Position/Portfolio entities have complex relationships that required careful mapping. We implemented a solution that maintains these relationships while ensuring type safety.
- **DateOrGenesis Type**: We've enhanced the handling of the DateOrGenesis type to correctly convert between Prisma dates and domain model dates.
- **Enum Types**: We've implemented proper type guards and conversion functions to ensure enum types are correctly handled.
- **Optional Properties**: We've improved the handling of optional properties with conditional property assignment, avoiding undefined or null values in the database.

### Next Steps

1. **Testing**

   - Implement tests to verify proper type conversion
   - Add integration tests to ensure end-to-end type safety for all repositories

2. **Documentation**

   - Update code comments to reflect the new patterns
   - Create examples for other developers on how to use the repositories with the new pattern

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Review database query patterns to ensure efficient loading of related entities
   - Consider adding caching for frequently accessed data
